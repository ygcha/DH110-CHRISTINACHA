# Financial Aid Resource Access in Massachusetts 
## Christina Cha, DH110 Fall 2021

### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Access to higher education has always been a topic of conversation amongst high school and college students, especially high school seniors as they apply to their dream colleges and universities. The topic of accessibility for these institutions is a crucial conversation to have especially with many underrepresented groups lacking resources or opportunities to get into higher education. In addition, the glamourization of higher education and academia in the media further pushes away the focus from the issue of accessibility and how it can be resolved. In this project, I want to explore how the government tackles this issue. What resources has the government made available specifically for underrepresented groups? Have these programs and websites actually improved the amount of underrepresented students that get into these elite institutions? Government support for this issue plays a large role in making the future demographic within academia diverse. I hope to further dive into these topics and questions to understand the current government involvement in making a more diverse and inclusive future.

### Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the [Massachusetts OSFA website](https://www.mass.edu/osfa/home/home.asp) and [MEFA](https://www.mefa.org/).
