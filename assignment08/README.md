# Financial Aid Resource Access in Massachusetts 
## Christina Cha, DH110 Fall 2021

### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Access to higher education has always been a topic of conversation amongst high school and college students, especially high school seniors as they apply to their dream colleges and universities. The topic of accessibility for these institutions is a crucial conversation to have especially with many underrepresented groups lacking resources or opportunities to get into higher education. In addition, the glamourization of higher education and academia in the media further pushes away the focus from the issue of accessibility and how it can be resolved. In this project, I want to explore how the government tackles this issue. What resources has the government made available specifically for underrepresented groups? Have these programs and websites actually improved the amount of underrepresented students that get into these elite institutions? Government support for this issue plays a large role in making the future demographic within academia diverse. I hope to further dive into these topics and questions to understand the current government involvement in making a more diverse and inclusive future.

### Clear design statement: 
After conducting a heuristic evaluation of the website, I found the top three issues that were challenging, unsatisfactory, and/or inefficient.

1. **Visibility of System Status**

> When searching up a specific phrase or keyword in the search bar, there is no automatic search suggestion in relation to what you are typing in OSFA’s search bar. Instead of having a drop-down menu with article suggestions, they depend on the user writing their full phrase out making it less efficient. In addition, there are no “Did you mean…” in the case the user makes a spelling or grammatical mistake.

2. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**

> The website tabs sometimes have more subtabs under the main subtabs. This can be confusing and frustrating to the user, especially if they do not keep their mouse stable on the drop-down tabs. In addition, the extra tabs sometimes have a long list of sites making it difficult to navigate.

3. **Error Prevention**

> Another key issue with the search bar is that instead of keeping the user at the OFSA website, it would divert the user to the main DHE website. This is hard to catch the first time, however, when the user attempts to go to another page, it will either confuse them due to the different website design/layout, or make their search time longer and less efficient.

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the [Massachusetts OSFA website](https://www.mass.edu/osfa/home/home.asp) and [MEFA](https://www.mefa.org/).
