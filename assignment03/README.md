# Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021

## ✅ Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
 My project would support users in Massachusetts who are looking for ways to find financial assistance to pay for college more easily through the Massachusetts' Office of Student Financial Assistance’s website. 

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity will fufill the basic needs of students and parents by helping them feel at ease and less anxious knowing that there is an easy way to look for financial assistance. In addition, it will prevent them from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of options and resources. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to provide resources for financial assistance is through various government and private company websites. More traditional solutions include financial aid counselors or pamphlets handed out in-person in classrooms by teachers. However, these methods are not the most efficient as it does not compile all the resources and information available in one place. In addition, printed pamphlets and guides can be easily lost by students whereas a properly organized websites can be accessed anytime and anywhere. 

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Printed materials may not always show the most updated information and resources that students and parents can use to get financial assistance. However, a well organized government website allows users to obtain the most up to date information, especially if the parents have multiple children in different grades. 

## ✅ Step02: Target users (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.44-51)
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
|Characteristics|Description|
|--|--|
|Demographics | seniors in high school, college students, parents |
|Preference| users that are in need of or looking for financial assistance|
|Expertise| users do not need any specific level of expertise to use the website|

### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
The users would look for financial resources and assistance before the start of a school year at home or in their dorms to make sure that they are financially equipped, whether it is through loans or financial aid, to pay for and attend college. 

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users, specifically parents, usually read the printed materials given to them by the school and their children or go online to look for more information. Student users on the other hand usually go online to find more resources and information. 

## ✅ Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
I completed the contextual inquiry through two methods: observing the participant and conducting an interview. For the participatory observation, I asked the participant to complete two activities. In the first task, I asked the participant to look up a website that they most commonly used in the past and are the most comfortable with to find more information on financial aid. In the second task, I asked the participant to use the website to find more information about the specific type of financial aid they needed more information on.

Both activities were conducted in the user’s apartment. I used my Samsung Note to voice record the interview and used an iPad to capture photos of the user completing the activities. Unfortunately, I had to use the same participant for this usability test as I could not find another in-person participant that was fit for the interview.

## ✅ Step 4: Observation/Interview Guide

## ✅ Step 5: Conducting the Research

Below are key points that I found interesting during the interview:

1️⃣ The biggest challenge with finding more information is knowing what websites to use.

2️⃣ Compared to Massachusetts OSFA, the user preferred the cleanliness and organization of FAFSA's website. 

3️⃣ The user did not like the white space and the way the tabs were organized for the Massachusetts OSFA website. 

## ✅ Step 6: Reflection
Before the interview, I had a general idea of the problem areas of the website that needed to be fixed and redesigned. However, this contextual inquiry gave me a closer look at which websites I should reference when redesigning the website.

The participant that I interviewed has previous experience with applying for financial aid so he had a clear vision of what he needed to look for and what type of information he needs. An interesting website he mentions is the my.ucla.edu website from UCLA. Because I mostly focused on other government websites, I did not think to reference other non-government affiliated websites in terms of how they organize their information and tabs. Another interesting part of the interview was that he mentioned how he liked the way FAFSA was organized. I agreed with how the simplicity of the website allowed the user to find information quicker and easier compared to the Massachusetts OSFA website. 

A challenge that I faced was writing the script for the Contextual Inquiry. As my project was based on a government website and the ease of finding information on financial aid, it was difficult to come up with questions that were general and overarching but making sure that it still was relevant and focused. During the actual interview, I noticed that I ended up asking the same questions for some of the sections due to the fact that the user already answered the specific question in the previous question. Next time, I would try to skip questions that have already been addressed and ask the user more about the specific actions and steps they were taking when completing the activities.
