# Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021

## ✅ Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
 My project would support users in Massachusetts who are looking for ways to find financial assistance to pay for college more easily through the Massachusetts' Office of Student Financial Assistance’s website. 

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity will fufill the basic needs of students and parents by helping them feel at ease and less anxious knowing that there is an easy way to look for financial assistance. In addition, it will prevent them from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of options and resources. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to provide resources for financial assistance is through various government and private company websites. More traditional solutions include financial aid counselors or pamphlets handed out in-person in classrooms by teachers. However, these methods are not the most efficient as it does not compile all the resources and information available in one place. In addition, printed pamphlets and guides can be easily lost by students whereas a properly organized websites can be accessed anytime and anywhere. 

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Printed materials may not always show the most updated information and resources that students and parents can use to get financial assistance. However, a well organized government website allows users to obtain the most up to date information, especially if the parents have multiple children in different grades. 

## ✅ Step02: Target users (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.44-51)
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
|Characteristics|Description|
|--|--|
|Demographics | seniors in high school, college students, parents |
|Preference| users that are in need of or looking for financial assistance|
|Expertise| users do not need any specific level of expertise to use the website|

### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
The users would look for financial resources and assistance before the start of a school year at home or in their dorms to make sure that they are financially equipped, whether it is through loans or financial aid, to pay for and attend college. 

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users, specifically parents, usually read the printed materials given to them by the school and their children or go online to look for more information. Student users on the other hand usually go online to find more resources and information. 

## ✅ Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
I completed the contextual inquiry through two methods: observing the participant and conducting an interview. For the participatory observation, I asked the participant to complete two activities. In the first task, I asked the participant to look up a website that they most commonly used in the past and are the most comfortable with to find more information on financial aid. In the second task, I asked the participant to use the website to find more information about the specific type of financial aid they needed more information on.

Both activities were conducted in the user’s apartment. I used my Samsung Note to voice record the interview and used an iPad to capture photos of the user completing the activities. Unfortunately, I had to use the same participant for this usability test as I could not find another in-person participant that was fit for the interview.
