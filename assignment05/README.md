# Assignment 05: LowFiPrototype | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021

## Overview
### Purpose
I will be redesigning the Massechusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance website for this project. Massachusetts OSFA is one of the offices within the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education that focuses on helping students finance their education, specifically for college. My main goal with this project is to redesign the website so that it easily caters to each individual’s financial needs and situation so that the website can recommend the proper scholarship, grants, loans, and other resources based on the individual’s criteria. 

For this assignment, I will be creating a low-fidelity prototype as it is an efficient and low-cost way to test the basic wireframes of a design before jumping into the final prototype and design of the product. In addition, testing the low-fidelity prototype allows us to test it and get feedback to see what problems we can fix and improve on during the early stages of the project.
