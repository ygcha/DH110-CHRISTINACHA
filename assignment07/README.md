# Assignment 07: HighFiPrototype | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021
---
## Description of Project
I will be redesigning the Massechusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance website for this project. Massachusetts OSFA is one of the offices within the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education that focuses on helping students finance their education, specifically for college. My main goal with this project is to redesign the website so that it easily caters to each individual’s financial needs and situation so that the website can recommend the proper scholarship, grants, loans, and other resources based on the individual’s criteria and need.

## Process
For this assignment, I used Figma to design and develop the rest of my high fidelity prototype. In addition, I took feedback from Professor Sookie, several classmates, and a participant outside of class. With this feedback, I improved the designs and interaction of my prototype.  I made sure that my high fidelity prototype reflected the intention of this project: a government website that both parents and students can easily use to find and track information about financial aid in Massechusetts.

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to test. sdfsdfadsfasdf.

## List of Tasks Supported by the Prototype

Task 1 - Create new profile, add 2 scholarships and 1 grant to the list based on award amount. 
Task 2 - Log-in, add 1 grant to the list based on award amount, and share the list via email. 

Specific tasks supported by the prototype:
> 1. Create a financial aid profile by signing up. 
> 2. Directly filter out financial aid options (scholarships and grants) based on highest award amount.
> 3. Add financial aid options (scholarships and grants) to your account as a list to keep track of which ones to apply too.
> 4. Share the financial aid list to another person via email.
> 5. Log in. 

These tasks are based on my two personas: Diana Kim and Sandy Smith.

> Diana Kim: A 17-year-old high school graduate with high technical literacy entering college who needs to efficiently find scholarships and grants that match her financial needs to attend her dream university: Harvard University. She wants to make sure she can keep track of which **scholarships and grants** she needs to apply to based on **the award amount **through her account.

> Sandy Smith: A 50-year-old homestay mom of two sons with low technical literacy and wants to find what type of scholarships and loans her son can apply to without a hassle in between her busy schedule. She wants to make sure her eldest son focuses on school without having to worry about which **grants** he needs to apply to. She wants to easily create a list of applications **she can share to her son through email**.
