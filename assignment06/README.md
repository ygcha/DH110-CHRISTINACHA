# Assignment 06: Interface Design | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021

## Description of Project
I will be redesigning the Massechusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance website for this project. Massachusetts OSFA is one of the offices within the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education that focuses on helping students finance their education, specifically for college. My main goal with this project is to redesign the website so that it easily caters to each individual’s financial needs and situation so that the website can recommend the proper scholarship, grants, loans, and other resources based on the individual’s criteria and need. 

## Process 
For this assignment, I used Figma to design and test multiple variations of fonts, shapes, and colors for the website's interface. As I have already digitized my [low-fidelity wireframes from the previous assignment](https://github.com/ygcha/DH110-CHRISTINACHA/tree/main/assignment05), I went ahead and implemented various graphic and interactive componenets by starting with one wireframe, which in this case was the home page. I made sure that the font family, color scheme, and shapes fit and reflected the intention of this project: a government website that both parents and students can easily use to find and track information about financial aid in Massechusetts.  

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to test multiple variations and see which element fit the website the best. When choosing the specific fonts, shapes, and colors, I made sure to choose the variation that suited an official government website the most. This meant that these elements had to convey a professional aesthetic to the users. I reviewed these variations with a participant to get insight on which elements I should go forward with. 

After trying various fonts, shapes, and colors, the wireframe below is an example of the current design of the website.
