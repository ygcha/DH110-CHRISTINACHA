# Assignment 06: Interface Design | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021

## Description of Project
I will be redesigning the Massechusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance website for this project. Massachusetts OSFA is one of the offices within the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education that focuses on helping students finance their education, specifically for college. My main goal with this project is to redesign the website so that it easily caters to each individual’s financial needs and situation so that the website can recommend the proper scholarship, grants, loans, and other resources based on the individual’s criteria and need. 

For this assignment, I went through multiple variations of fonts, shapes, and colors when designing the interface for the website. The multiple variations allowed me to test and see which element fit the website the best which is the purpose of this assignment. I also reviewed these variations with a participant to get insight on which element I should go forward with. After trying various fonts, shapes, and colors, the wireframe below is an example of the current design of the website.
