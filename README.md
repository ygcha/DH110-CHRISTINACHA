# Financial Aid Resource Access in Massachusetts

## Introduction
This project is about redesigning the Massachusetts' Office of Student Financial Assistance website in order to make it easier for both students and parents to find and organize financial aid resources in one website. Access to higher education has always been a topic of conversation amongst high school and college students, especially high school seniors as they apply to their dream colleges and universities. The topic of accessibility for these institutions is a crucial conversation to have especially with many underrepresented groups lacking resources or opportunities to get into higher education. Therefore, I wanted to design a website that can easily cater to both students and parents by making sure it is accessible for anyone regardless of their technical experience. Features like the “Add to My List” button and “Share List” function allows anyone to easily add and save specific financial aid resources and share it with their children or parents.

## Design Statement
Through my UX design project, I hope to help students, parents, and families, especially those in underrepresented groups, to easily find, save, and track different types of financial aid resources so that they can apply and receive financial assistance for college with ease. This is an important issue to tackle as it is crucial for the current state government to work towards creating a more diverse and inclusive future for all college students. With the current design of Massachusetts’ Office of Student Financial Assistance website, it is difficult for students and parents to properly know what to look for and where to find the different financial aid resources in an organized manner. 

## Competitor Analysis
To understand how the main financial aid websites in Massachusetts designed their interface, I conducted heuristic evaluations on two different websites: Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA) and Massachusetts’ Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA). I analyzed these sites because they were both focused on helping students and parents find financial aid resources and create a plan for college. In addition, I wanted to redesign the Massachusetts’ OFfice of Student Financial Assistance website. Analyzing these sites against Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics allows me to understand how each site decided to present different types of information and how that affects users’ experience. 

In addition, I conducted usability testing specifically for the Massachusetts’ Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA) website to understand the pain points of the website from the user’s perspective and how I can improve these issues through my redesign. For example, one issue my participant noted was that the website was a bit cluttered and not organized well. Although this did not prevent him from completing the tasks, it showed that the website’s visibility of system status and error prevention can be improved.

## User Research
I completed a contextual inquiry through two methods: observing the participant and conducting an interview. For the participatory observation, I asked the participant to complete two activities. In the first task, I asked the participant to look up a website that they most commonly used in the past and are the most comfortable with to find more information on financial aid. In the second task, I asked the participant to use the website to find more information about the specific type of financial aid they needed more information on. The participant was able to give me insightful thoughts and opinions such as giving examples of other financial aid websites he found easy to use including FAFSA and my.ucla.edu. In addition, he also explained why he found those websites easy to use  which helped him find information quicker and easier compared to the Massachusetts OSFA website. Overall, this contextual inquiry gave me a closer look at which websites I should reference when redesigning the website for OSFA.

## UX storytelling 
The main purpose of UX storytelling is to see your product in another perspective, specifically the user's perspective. By finding more pain points, the more we know what parts of the product need improvement and fixing. This is so that we have a better understanding of the user's journey and need to help you design a better product that is catered for the user. In order to understand my product from another point of view, I created two personas and scenarios that reflected the target audience for the website. The first persona represents your typical college freshman while the second persona represents a parent of a high school senior or college student.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design
Based on my personas’ perspective, I wanted to incorporate four different features into the website. This includes:
- Directly filter out financial aid options (scholarships, grants, loans, etc) based on award amount and due date.
- Create a financial aid profile.
- Add financial aid options (scholarships, grants, loans, etc) to your account as a list to keep track of which ones to apply too.
- Share financial aid lists with others via email.

With these features in mind, I incorporated it into the scenarios I created when developing the wireframe and screen designs. I wanted the website to be simple yet sophisticated so it fits the government aesthetic. In addition, I wanted to make sure the user interface was intuitive to use.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
I created a low-fidelity prototype as it allowed me to test the different features and layouts and get feedback to see what problems I can fix and improve on during the early stages of the project. In addition, it helped me check to see if the user was able to understand the flow of the website without any issues. 
Based on my user research, I created two tasks for the user to complete and test. 
- Task 1: Filter out scholarships based on award amount and add to your list (Begins with clicking tab on home page)
- Task 2: Create profile, add financial aid options to a list on your account, and share list with another user via email. (Begins with clicking sign up on home page)

## High-Fidelity Prototype 
After developing and testing the low-fidelity prototype, I created a high-fidelity prototype of my website using FIgma. When creating this prototype, I wanted to focus on creating a concrete visualization of what the final version of the website would look like and test it with various participants.  I first designed how the website would look visually by implementing various UI components, graphic elements, and different features. Then I created multiple versions and variations of the color schemes (light-mode and dark-mode), text and font family, and shapes. I then tested these variations with different participants to see which visual elements worked the best. I continued to revise and test my high-fidelity prototype before coming up with the final prototype below.
