- The main purpose of UX storytelling is to see your product in another perspective, specifically the user's perspective.

## 🗺 User Scenarios and Journey Maps
### Diane Kim's Scenario

Feature: Auto suggestion dropdown in search bar
#### Why
> Diane continues to work her two jobs to support her family. She is already busy trying to juggle work and her high school classes. She wants to make sure that her financial aid package is situated before she graduates high school and starts school at Harvard University in the fall. In order to complete this goal on time, she prefers if the website had short cuts and properly organized categories to save time. 

#### How 
> After work, Diane goes back home into her room and turns on her desktop computer to start looking for more information on grants and scholarships in Massachusetts. She opens the website (https://www.mass.edu/osfa/home/home.asp) and heads directly to the search bar at the upper right corner. She is not sure exactly what to search besides the keyword “scholarship”. She hopes that the website will give her suggestions as she types. As she types the first couple letters of “scholarship”, the search bar auto populates the rest of her word and drops a list of possible word combinations like “scholarship information”, “Financial Aid Programs”, and “Agnes M. Lindsay Scholarship Program”. This helped her to find more information efficiently without having to dig and search through the entire website by testing out various keyword combinations. Feeling satisfied with the automatic dropdown suggestions, she clicks the “Financial Aid Programs” suggestion to learn more about her options.

### Sandy Smith's Scenario

Feature: Organized tabs with changed layout in the front page

#### Why
> Sandy is a mother of two sons and wants to make sure her first son in 12th grade is financially ready for college by the time he graduates high school. Although she is looking for scholarships and grants, she is also looking into how to apply for loans. To lift the burden off her son’s shoulder, she wants to look for more information online. But she is not tech savvy as she has not used a lot of complicated websites. She would prefer the website to have clean organized tabs and sections so she can easily navigate through the website without much struggle.

#### How 
> After she picks up her sons from school, Sandy goes into her room and turns on her laptop to begin searching for more information on loans and grants. She goes to the website (https://www.mass.edu/osfa/home/home.asp) and takes a look at the website. At first she is not sure what to click as this is her first time seeing the website. However, after a minute, she notices that the website is organized into various sections and tabs based on the type of financial need. Wanting to learn more about loans, she clicks the middle section button labeled “Loans”. It directs her to a part of the website that lists the eligibility criteria and instructions on how to apply. She is satisfied as it did not take much effort to find the information.
