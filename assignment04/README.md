## 🗺 User Scenarios and Journey Maps
### Diane Kim's Scenario

Feature: Auto suggestion dropdown in search bar
#### Why
> Diane continues to work her two jobs to support her family. She is already busy trying to juggle work and her high school classes. She wants to make sure that her financial aid package is situated before she graduates high school and starts school at Harvard University in the fall. In order to complete this goal on time, she prefers if the website had short cuts and properly organized categories to save time. 

#### How 
> After work, Diane goes back home into her room and turns on her desktop computer to start looking for more information on grants and scholarships in Massachusetts. She opens the website (https://www.mass.edu/osfa/home/home.asp) and heads directly to the search bar at the upper right corner. She is not sure exactly what to search besides the keyword “scholarship”. She hopes that the website will give her suggestions as she types. As she types the first couple letters of “scholarship”, the search bar auto populates the rest of her word and drops a list of possible word combinations like “scholarship information”, “Financial Aid Programs”, and “Agnes M. Lindsay Scholarship Program”. This helped her to find more information efficiently without having to dig and search through the entire website by testing out various keyword combinations. Feeling satisfied with the automatic dropdown suggestions, she clicks the “Financial Aid Programs” suggestion to learn more about her options.
