# Assignment 02 Pilot Usability Test | Christina Cha, DH 110 F2021 


## Introduction
Massachusetts' Office of Student Financial Assistance is responsible for providing students in Massachusetts the proper resources and opportunities to ensure that students are able to pay for college. They offer various tools and resources such as information about scholarships, financial aid, grants, and more. This website is crucial for students and parents who are looking to get financial assistance in paying for college. 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation of the website, I found the top three issues that were challenging, unsatisfactory, and/or inefficient. 

### 1. Visibility of System Status
When searching up a specific phrase or keyword in the search bar, there is no automatic search suggestion in relation to what you are typing in OSFA’s search bar. Instead of having a drop-down menu with article suggestions, they depend on the user writing their full phrase out making it less efficient. In addition, there are no “Did you mean…” in the case the user makes a spelling or grammatical mistake. 

### 2. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
The website tabs sometimes have more subtabs under the main subtabs. This can be confusing and frustrating to the user, especially if they do not keep their mouse stable on the drop-down tabs. In addition, the extra tabs sometimes have a long list of sites making it difficult to navigate. 

### 3. Error Prevention
Another key issue with the search bar is that instead of keeping the user at the OFSA website, it would divert the user to the main DHE website. This is hard to catch the first time, however, when the user attempts to go to another page, it will either confuse them due to the different website design/layout, or make their search time longer and less efficient.

I will be conducting and performing a usability test where I will ask the participant to complete three tasks. 
TASK | DESCRIPTION  
|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status| Use OSFA’s search bar to search more articles about loans.|
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use| Find more information about the “Need-Based Tuition Waiver Program” using the tabs on the home page.| 
|Error Prevention| Use OSFA’s search bar to search “Financial Aid” and then navigate back to the home page.|

## Methodology
I will conduct the usability test in a quiet room using Zoom where I can record the pilot test using my MacBook Pro. I will be talking to the participant through a Zoom meeting where they will share their screen. I will provide background information about the test and ask for their informed consent before continuing with the survey. They will first complete the pre-test question to record their initial impression of the website. Then I will have them complete three different tasks to see how the level of comfort and satisfaction the user experiences through the website. The user will then give feedback by answering the post-test questions to record their overall experience with completing the three tasks. Finally, the user will then fill out a section with demographic questions which will be kept confidential and anonymous. 

This usability test is intended as a pilot test.
